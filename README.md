# Lab 5: Clustering Techniques Using DBSCAN and Hierarchical Clustering

## Overview
This lab explores clustering techniques applied to the Wine dataset using Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN.

## Key Insights
- **Hierarchical Clustering** achieved a Silhouette Score of 0.277.
- **DBSCAN Clustering** achieved a Silhouette Score of 0.191, Homogeneity Score of 0.031, and Completeness Score of 0.135.
- Hierarchical Clustering formed compact clusters, while DBSCAN identified two clusters and some noise points.

## Challenges
- Tuning DBSCAN parameters (eps, min_samples) was crucial for meaningful clusters.
- Visualizing high-dimensional data required dimensionality reduction to 2D scatter plots.
